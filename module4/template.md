# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?
Giftedness/child prodigies

What do you know about?
Went to University at 8, didn't become famous/do anything super amazing with that early start in life, possibly related to
parents being poor and stressed.

What decisions do you face?
How to better design curriculums/life onboarding experience for kids going thru similar things.

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Is giftedness geographical? (Room mate talking about Hungary having a ton of math geniuses)

2. Trend related to the news
Is the Flynn effect really a thing? Are we getting way smarter faster than should be evolutionarily possible?

3. Who does that?
Are men and women equally likely to be gifted in different domains? Saw a thing about how 3/4ths of people in math programs after 14 are male but it's 50/50 before that. 

4. Answering a question people care about
Can society systematically find ways to use gifted people?

5. Valuable to businesses
Where can businesses find gifted people to employ?

6. What's the most popular?
Distributions of giftedness (language, math, art, music, probably a bunch of others idk about)

7. Cost/Money rankings
No idea yet :(

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
Child prodigies are produced by crazy parents, gifted kids are more likely to be well adjusted, people are usually 'evenly' gifted,
gifted kids are not special needs, they are all awkward/clueless,

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
Terman longitudinal study on high IQ

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Their hypothesis is still interesting now, programming is a job and there is more intellectual work to be done now.

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
TBD

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
TBD

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
Probably data sets in the citations of random books on this/related topics like insulin, salt, trans fats, documentaries about epidemics.

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?
Obesity/health

What do you know about?
Getting stronger but not losing fat easily, yet.

What decisions do you face?

3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about
Do women really live slightly longer than men if they are equally healthy? Since men seem to care less about their health in every culture I've ever witnessed/let themselves go more.

5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings
